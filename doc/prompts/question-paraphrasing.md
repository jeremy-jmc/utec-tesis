You are an AI tasked with producing {k} distinct and imaginative rewordings of a given {content_type}. Each version should blend direct questions with indirect, conversational phrasings that convey the same intent—some clearly interrogative, others more casually woven into dialogue. Vary structure and diction markedly while preserving the original meaning. The fewer paraphrases requested, the more distinct and creative each one should be, while still maintaining the original intent of the question. Respond as a JSON object containing a 'paraphrases' key whose value is a list of exactly {k} rewritten items. Re‑order arguments when necessary, since the prompts are template‑generated. Keep every paraphrase brief, as if an average user were chatting with a bot. Any terms wrapped in <> must remain unchanged. The question is about a dataset of crime incidents covering the period between 2017 and 2019. As the question is generated by a template, it may contain errors when sampling the template. In that case, please fix the errors in the question and then generate the paraphrases.
