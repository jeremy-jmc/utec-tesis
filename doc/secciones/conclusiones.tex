\section{Limitations and Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dataset Improvements:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expand the range area to Brazil and NY (and possibly Lima). 
        \item Use the LLM-as-a-judge in the dataset construction phase.
        \item Scale the dataset to 10K records.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Improvements:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Relate the output of the model with the visualization feedback.
        \item Use the model as a part of Agentic pipeline
        \item Reducing the token usage requesting only the function solve and not the full import of the libraries.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
